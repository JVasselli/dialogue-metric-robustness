How about Giannis Antetokounmpo! He's such a great player! <|endoftext|>Good call! I have always been, watched all 82 games when we won only 15 of them a few years back! Yeah Giannis has been a gamechanger for our whole organization. Do you have a favorite team? <|endoftext|>I'm a Memphis Grizzlies fan, but enjoy watching a good game no matter who's playing. I really like watching Stephen Curry and LeBron James. Did you know that they both were born in Akron, Ohio? <|endoftext|>No, I didn't know that about them, interesting. And the Grizz, curious to see how you will be in a few seasons, was surprised to see Gasol leave. <|endoftext|>Yeah, it's hard to replace someone like him. I do like the pickup they made with Noah. Hopefully they'll continue building up. <|endoftext|>Yeah and Jonas is a monster and a workhorse as well. <|endoftext|>Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned upon introduction by the NBA? However, Jordan wore them anyways, as Nike was willing to pay the fine each game. <|endoftext|>Yeah, I think I have read that. Nike got the best marketing they ever could so I'm sure they were happy to pay! <|endoftext|>I bet they were too. Shoe companies have a way spending money on their investments. Allen Iverson signed a lifetime deal with Reebok in 2001. He'll get $800,000 a year until he's 55. <|endoftext|>I bet they are wishing they could take that back. I think that they thought they were signing the next Jordan. <|endoftext|>He did make a lot for Reebok, but they still didn't sell as well as Jordans. <|endoftext|>No, and not for the length of time that Jordan has, and probably will continue to be. <|endoftext|>LeBron is about Jordan's only shoe competitor. Did you hear that he has signed a deal with Warner Bros for a new \"Space Jam\" sequel? <|endoftext|>No, I didn't see that. I wonder when it will be released? <|endoftext|>I'm not really sure. Maybe it will be as good as the original. LeBron has a good character about him though. He raised $6 million for charity by televising \"The Decision.\" <|endoftext|>He is a really good person, I know he has donated a ton of money back to Ohio.",

Dunno if you're familiar with them, but Studio Ghibli has made a lot of great animated films, like Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke.<|endoftext|>I don't think I have heard of them. I have heard that one of the directors recently passed away, and his last film was nominated for an Academy Award.<|endoftext|>Yeah, sadly, Disney (which owns the American rights to the films) doesn't tend to promote them very much. I think they're worried they'll cut into their \"homegrown\" market. Anyway, dunno if you even like animated movies, but they're worth checking out.<|endoftext|>I don't watch them very often. Apparently, there was a showing of the recent film in a park in D.C. That's one U.S. city I haven't been to.<|endoftext|>Sadly, I haven't been to DC either, although I've always wanted to visit there. Apparently, there's a lot of interesting things going down this summer. They're having a crab feast at the Navy-Marine Corps Stadium. They'll have 100 gallons of crab soup! Can you imagine that much soup?<|endoftext|>I recently met a girl who lives in that area, and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for. It sounds like many of the events feature jazz music. Do you listen to jazz very often?<|endoftext|>A little bit, I'm not too familiar with it. I know it originated in New Orleans and a little bit about the history, but that's about it. Heard Clint Eastwood is a big jazz fan, thought that was pretty interesting...<|endoftext|>There are many different styles, probably derived from the various regions in the US where it has taken root. Kansas City is another place where it has prominence.<|endoftext|>You know there's a programming language in which programs are written in musical composition, and so the programs have jazz-like harmonies. As a computer guy, I find that pretty fascinating. So, have you ever been to a live concert? (Jazz or otherwise?)<|endoftext|>That is interesting. I haven't been to a live concert recently, but I went to many when I was younger. Most of them were in smaller venues though.<|endoftext|>It's been a while since I've been to any as well. Got a friend of mine, he's big into the Ramones and seen them in concert a few times. Get this, they've played a total of 2,263 concerts, touring almost non-stop for over twenty years. Now that's dedication to your music!<|endoftext|>I can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well. Sometimes I think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they're like. Pink Floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a Roman one in Pompeii.<|endoftext|>Wonder why they did it without an audience? Pretty sure people would have shown if they'd heard about it. Must be one of those \"eccentric rock and roll musician\" things. Wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater...<|endoftext|>It might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater. There's another ancient amphitheater in Croatia that's used for concerts. Those Romans really liked their theaters.<|endoftext|>Well, theaters were a big event at the time, plays, gladiator events, concerts... You gotta remember, they didn't have the internet back then, so they had to do something for entertainment. :) So, what was the last concert you ever attended?<|endoftext|>Now that I think about it, I went to one a little over a year ago around Christmastime, so most of the songs were Christmas songs.

I see the point of the event, but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status<|endoftext|>Yes, I think you're right, how often do you go to the library btw? <|endoftext|>Not very often since most of what I borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks.

What do you think about the Norway government though? If you publish a book you are guaranteed to get at least 1000 sales because they will buy your books and put them in libraries all over the country<|endoftext|>I think it encourages writers in their country, that's for sure! I would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book<|endoftext|>Well, you should do a children's book then, because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol<|endoftext|>Children's books require less writing and more illustrations.
