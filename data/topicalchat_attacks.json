Crazy how that stuff carries over until even today!!<|endoftext|>It is! There's a lot things we need to discover still though, I'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater, at least some of them.<|endoftext|>Ya it's only about 3 inches thick, I wonder how it is protected?

We sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using.<|endoftext|>Haha, yeah, if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing! Haha<|endoftext|>Yeah, that would be great, literature is getting lost and great authors like CS Lewis and Tolkien are getting forgotten.<|endoftext|>Right, I think it's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose, that's hilarious<|endoftext|>That is hilarious. I wonder who is the champion among them lol. Do you personally like to read?<|endoftext|>I can't say that I do no, I do like audiobooks, I did try to speed read once but I found I didn't retain any information from it, that's why I don't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute.<|endoftext|>I wonder how they measure that, I can just skip pages and tell everybody that I read the content, I bet I could read 6000 words per minute that way<|endoftext|>Ya exactly, if I could just flip through pages I could speed read too, what is weird is Starship Troopers is on the military's reading list, idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro-military<|endoftext|>I guess that's because books aren't as good as movies, a lot of info is missing, the Ender's Game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe<|endoftext|>Ya, did you ever see that movie?

He was 87. Major League Baseball announced the death but did not disclose the cause. According to media accounts, he had battled throat cancer in the 1990s and later had several strokes. Mr. Harvey worked 4,673 ballgames from 1962 to 1992, MLB said, including five World Series, nine National League Championship Series and six All-Star Games. For 18 years, he was an umpiring crew chief. Hundreds of thousands of times he made on-the-spot calls on whether a runner had reached base a millisecond before a throw from a fielder, or whether a pitched ball traveling 90 mph had grazed the veneer of a loosely defined strike zone or missed altogether. The outcome of baseball championships rested on such rulings. Players and fans held strong and differing opinions on what the umpire saw, and they were not shy about telling him when they saw it differently. In 2009, Doug Harvey, right, jokes about throwing former St. Louis Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog out of a game. (Michael Conroy/AP) To Mr. Harvey, arguments with the umpires were a part of the game, but there were limits and there could be no doubt about who was boss. \"I would listen for 20 seconds,\" he once told The New York Times. \"I would count to 20 to myself. And I would listen to everything you had to say.\""

He was 87. Major League Baseball announced the death but did not disclose the cause. According to media accounts, he had battled throat cancer in the 1990s and later had several strokes. Mr. Harvey worked 4,673 ballgames from 1962 to 1992, MLB said, including five World Series, nine National League Championship Series and six All-Star Games. For 18 years, he was an umpiring crew chief. Hundreds of thousands of times he made on-the-spot calls on whether a runner had reached base a millisecond before a throw from a fielder, or whether a pitched ball traveling 90 mph had grazed the veneer of a loosely defined strike zone or missed altogether. The outcome of baseball championships rested on such rulings. Players and fans held strong and differing opinions on what the umpire saw, and they were not shy about telling him when they saw it differently. In 2009, Doug Harvey, right, jokes about throwing former St. Louis Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog out of a game. (Michael Conroy/AP) To Mr. Harvey, arguments with the umpires were a part of the game, but there were limits and there could be no doubt about who was boss. \"I would listen for 20 seconds,\" he once told The New York Times. \"I would count to 20 to myself. And I would listen to everything you had to say.\""

There is a place on Earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet. It is the Hudson Bay region of Canada. <|endoftext|>I wonder how much affect that has?

Did you know that there are cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks! <|endoftext|>Lol yeah, there's all sorts of cafes like that, I've been to a meerkat cafe, a bird cafe, and a raccoon cafe before. <|endoftext|>That is really interesting. I would like that. I wish I slept as much as cats. When a cat reaches 15 years old, it has usually spent 10 years of its life sleeping. <|endoftext|>That's a lot of sleeping!

Facebook spokeswoman Katy Dormer said the company also launched an investigation earlier this week into Predictim’s extraction, or “scraping,” of personal data. That investigation is ongoing and could include further penalties. Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio said the site conducted its own investigation earlier this week and revoked Predictim’s access to important site tools—known as Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs—that would allow the start-up to review and analyze babysitters' tweets on a massive scale. \"We strictly prohibit the use of Twitter data and APIs for surveillance purposes, including performing background checks,\" Pacilio said. The crackdown, which was first reported by BBC News, could restrict Predictim’s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called “advanced artificial intelligence” and sell parents the results. The service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter’s life. But Predictim’s executives said Tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Predictim Chief Executive and Co-founder Sal Parsa said he also believed the social media giants' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use. “Twitter and Facebook are already mining our data."

Twitter spokesman Nick Pacilio said the site conducted its own investigation earlier this week and revoked Predictim’s access to important site tools—known as Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs—that would allow the start-up to review and analyze babysitters' tweets on a massive scale. \"We strictly prohibit the use of Twitter data and APIs for surveillance purposes, including performing background checks,\" Pacilio said. The crackdown, which was first reported by BBC News, could restrict Predictim’s ability to analyze babysitters with what it called “advanced artificial intelligence” and sell parents the results. The service was heavily criticized for offering unproven and potentially inaccurate results that could affect a babysitter’s life. But Predictim’s executives said Tuesday they were undeterred and intend to continue pulling publicly available data from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Predictim Chief Executive and Co-founder Sal Parsa said he also believed the social media giants' reaction was at least partially rooted in a competitive rivalry over personal data use. “Twitter and Facebook are already mining our data."
